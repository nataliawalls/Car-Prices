There are a few ways we can go about this. The first way is that we will try a model to predict just the numerical value of the sale price. The second way to go about this will be to predict whether or not the car sold over the MMR price. Car's are a very big aspect of any American's life, so the knowledge of how much a car is going to cost is something relevant to many people.\n","\n","We find this project interesting for the same reason. Car's are a very large part of the culture in the U.S. and it will be interesting to see if there are any surprising factors in what makes a car sell well.\n","\n","The data we found has several descriptive characteristics along with the price so there is lots of data for us to compare here. And I definitely think that this will be a challenging enough question, because the range of factors is very very broad, and predict specific values can oftentimes be very challenging.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"M_qzPckxpYwQ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ipKGhNLDgHDz"},"source":["## Team members:\n","- Natalia (manager): Will work on models to predict the sale prices of the cars.\n","- Sam: Will focus predicting whether or not the car will sell for above or below the MMR depending on certain factors of the car.\n","- Ruben: Will analyze issues with models we are working on."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"hRe6DX0ZgHD0"},"source":["## Manager's section\n","\n","The manager should, over several paragraphs, describe the expected challenges for this project. Talk about the parts you think will be difficult (doing the modeling? preparing the data? keeping team members on-task?) and how you plan to address them. Specifically list out goals for yourself in terms of these challenges. I will check in with you throughout the semester on how you are progressing with these goals in order to help you succeed. Talk about why each team member was given each of their duties and responsibilities. Talk about your overall goals for the project. What are the things you are hoping to accomplish for this project to be considered a success? Is it an accuracy goal? Is it being able to explain a complex question in an easy way? Is it to add new insight to an important problem? Be as specific as possible. During your final presentation I will be looking for whether or not you achieved these goals, so they must be clearly defined and not overly broad."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["In this project, the first challenge we see that we will have is that all of us are big procrastinators, so I fear that we will wait until the last minute to start on this project, and end up with very baseline information. One way we can overcome this is to preplan two meetings before the practice presentation to see our progress, then another two meetings before the real presentation. Of course, depending on the progress in these meetings we may add more meetings if we deem it helpful. Another challenge I see coming is that with our data set we can really only predict prices of the cars, so I fear that some people may be without analysis work, or feel like they do not want to overstep in other people's work, but I feel like only having price to predict can be a really good thing because we can go in a lot of depth in our models. Another challenge is that the make of the car has many different unique values, so it may make the predictions a little wonky.\n","\n","A goal I have for our team is to start on this project early, and to work on it consistently instead of one or two big chunks of time. Another goal I have for us to go into a lot of depth with our models becuase in my last project I felt like my team only scratched the surface with the regressions and I feel like we could have done so much more, doing this will make me feel like this project is a successful one."],"metadata":{"id":"2NStPXDur0UV"}}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.2"},"colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"1IzpPWXshmARYo8766v2PcXRB4ZIaDe2v","timestamp":1677444811344}]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
