# Car-Prices
#Dataset was too large to upload here, but is available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ananaymital/us-used-cars-dataset . In addition to the csv file, my team made use of the informative PDF and sector legend included.

Samuel Flusche, Ruben Valdovinos, and I looked into the analysis of how much cars were sold out and worked on seeing how to predict the prices based on car's metrics. We used many different regression models to predict these prices. Here is a LinkedIn article summarizing our findings: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-much-your-car-worth-natalia-walls/?published=t&trackingId=U%2BqrmyDfvDZNSPPS8JUtgQ%3D%3D
